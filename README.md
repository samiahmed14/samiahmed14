## 🌐 About Me

I am a graduate student at the University of Central Florida pursuing an M.S. in Statistics and Data Science. I am passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real world problems with machine learning, automation, and scalable deployment. My work spans supervised learning, natural language processing, MLOps pipelines, and cloud deployed AI applications. I enjoy creating end to end solutions that combine data engineering, model development, and production level deployment.

My professional experience includes developing machine learning models, building full stack AI applications, deploying models on AWS ECS and EC2, and implementing automated CI/CD workflows. I enjoy solving challenging problems and writing clean, reproducible code.
